        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I am proficient in the python programming language and it is my primary development tool. 
            I am also familiar with technologies such as C/C++, Java, Git and linux. I've briefly 
            explored Machine Learning through a few projects.

                <h3>1. Google Summer of Code with MBDyn (2024 & 2025)</h3>
                <p>
                    I was selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">
                    Google Summer of Code</a> contributor for the <a href="https://www.mbdyn.org/" target="_blank">
                    MBDyn</a> open-source project for two consecutive years. I successfully completed my 
                    2024 project and am currently developing new features for 2025.
                </p>
            
                <strong>Completed Project (GSoC 2024): Building a Modern Python Preprocessor</strong>
                <p>
                    My primary goal was to build a user-friendly Python library to make creating 
                    complex engineering simulations in MBDyn easier. The complete work of 2024 can be found 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Shimul-Baidya/MBDyn/compare/13ad754e72703d297607b6a9c61bd43885ade52f...7b8386151c6f6f61b6881b6ffae513927063761e" target="_blank">
                    here</a>. My key contributions included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Expanded Core Functionality:</strong> I extended the library to support all major 
                        MBDyn entities (like nodes, elements, and drivers), making it a comprehensive tool for 
                        building a wide variety of models.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Improved Model Control:</strong> I developed new Python classes to manage simulation 
                        settings, giving users precise control over initial conditions and runtime behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Created a Model Container:</strong> I designed a central "Model" class to hold all 
                        parts of a simulation, organizing everything into a single, clean, and easy-to-manage object.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <strong>Ongoing Project (GSoC 2025): High-Level Tools & Blender Integration</strong>
                <p>
                    My current work focuses on making the preprocessor even more powerful and accessible:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rotorcraft Modeling API:</strong> I am transforming a command-line tool for modeling 
                        rotorcraft (like helicopters and drones) into a simple Python API. This will allow users to 
                        build these complex models with intuitive commands instead of verbose configuration files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Blender Integration:</strong> I am integrating the Python preprocessor directly into 
                        Blendyn (a Blender addon). This will create a seamless, all-in-one environment where users 
                        can build, run, and visualize advanced simulations without ever leaving Blender.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Book Recommendation System</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a collaborative filtering based book recommendation system. I have implemented a web app for this
                    recommendation system too. In this recommendation system, when users search for a book by its name, it shows
                    5 other best matching books related to that book.
                    <br>
                    I have utilized <code>csr_matrix</code> data structure from <code>scipy.sparse</code> and 
                    <code>NearestNeighbors</code> class from <code>sklearn.neighbors</code> in this project.

                <h3>3. Snake Game</h3>
                <p>
                    The game revolves around controlling a snake, represented by a line or series of connected blocks, within a
                    bounded playing area. The snake moves continuously in a specific direction, and the player's objective is to guide
                    the snake to consume food items scattered throughout the playing field.
                    <br>
                    I have used <code>Object Oriented Programming</code> features of python to build this project.
